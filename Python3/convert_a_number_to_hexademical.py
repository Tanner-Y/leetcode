# https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/

# Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

# Note:

# All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
# The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
# The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

class Solution:
    def toHex(self, num: int) -> str:
        if num == 0:
            return "0"
        if num > 0:
            return self.r_hex(num)
        else:
            return self.r_hex((2**32) + num)
    def r_hex(self, num):    
        if num == 0:
            return ""
        hexes = "0123456789abcdef"
        return self.r_hex(num//16) + hexes[num%16]
